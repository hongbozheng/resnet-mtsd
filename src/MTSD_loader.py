        Generates a `tf.data.Dataset` from image files in a directory

        If your directory structure is :

        ```
         main_directory/
        ...class_a/
        ......a_image_1.jpg
        ......a_image_2.jpg
        ...class_b/
        ......b_image_1.jpg
        ......b_image_2.jpg
        ```

        Then calling `image_dataset_from_directory(main_directory,
        labels='inferred')` will return a `tf.data.Dataset` that yields batches of
        images from the subdirectories `class_a` and `class_b`, together with labels
        0 and 1 (0 corresponding to `class_a` and 1 corresponding to `class_b`).
        Supported image formats: jpeg, png, bmp, gif.
        Animated gifs are truncated to the first frame.

        :param directory: Directory where the data is located.
                          If `labels` is "inferred", it should contain
                          subdirectories, each containing images for a class.
                          otherwise, the directory structure is ignored.
        :param labels: Either "inferred" (labels are generated from the directory structure),
                       None (no labels), or a list/tuple of integer labels of the same size
                       as the number of image files found in the directory.
                       Labels should be sorted according to the alphanumeric order of
                       the image file paths (obtained via `os.walk(directory)` in Python).
        :param label_mode: String describing the encoding of `labels`. Options are:
                           - 'int': means that the labels are encoded as integers
                             (e.g. for `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss).
                           - 'categorical' means that the labels are
                             encoded as a categorical vector
                             (e.g. for `categorical_crossentropy` loss).
                           - 'binary' means that the labels (there can be only 2)
                             are encoded as `float32` scalars with values 0 or 1
                             (e.g. for `binary_crossentropy`).
                           - None (no labels).
        :param class_names: Only valid if "labels" is "inferred". This is the explicit
                            list of class names (must match names of subdirectories). Used
                            to control the order of the classes
                            (otherwise alphanumerical order is used).
        :param color_mode: One of "grayscale", "rgb", "rgba". Default: "rgb".
                           Whether the images will be converted to have 1, 3, or 4 channels.
        :param batch_size: Size of the batches of data. Default: 32.
                           If `None`, the data will not be batched
                           (the dataset will yield individual samples).
        :param image_size: Size to resize images to after they are read from disk,
                           specified as `(height, width)`. Defaults to `(256, 256)`.
                           Since the pipeline processes batches of images that must all have
                           the same size, this must be provided.
        :param shuffle: Whether to shuffle the data. Default: True.
                        If set to False, sorts the data in alphanumeric order.
        :param seed: Optional random seed for shuffling and transformations.
        :param validation_split: Optional float between 0 and 1,
                                 fraction of data to reserve for validation.
        :param subset: Subset of the data to return.
                       One of "training", "validation" or "both".
                       Only used if `validation_split` is set.
                       When `subset="both"`, the utility returns a tuple of two datasets
                       (the training and validation datasets respectively).
        :param interpolation: String, the interpolation method used when resizing images.
                              Defaults to `bilinear`. Supports `bilinear`, `nearest`, `bicubic`,
                              `area`, `lanczos3`, `lanczos5`, `gaussian`, `mitchellcubic`.
        :param follow_links: Whether to visit subdirectories pointed to by symlinks.
                             Defaults to False.
        :param crop_to_aspect_ratio: If True, resize the images without aspect ratio distortion.
                                     When the original aspect ratio differs from the target
                                     aspect ratio, the output image will be cropped so as to
                                     return the largest possible window in the image
                                     (of size `image_size`) that matches the target aspect ratio.
                                     By default (`crop_to_aspect_ratio=False`),
                                     aspect ratio may not be preserved.
        :param kwargs: Legacy keyword arguments.

        A `tf.data.Dataset` object.
        - If `label_mode` is None, it yields `float32` tensors of shape
          `(batch_size, image_size[0], image_size[1], num_channels)`,
          encoding images (see below for rules regarding `num_channels`).
        - Otherwise, it yields a tuple `(images, labels)`, where `images`
          has shape `(batch_size, image_size[0], image_size[1], num_channels)`,
          and `labels` follows the format described below.

        Rules regarding labels format:
            - if `label_mode` is `int`, the labels are an `int32` tensor of shape
              `(batch_size,)`.
            - if `label_mode` is `binary`, the labels are a `float32` tensor of
              1s and 0s of shape `(batch_size, 1)`.
            - if `label_mode` is `categorical`, the labels are a `float32` tensor
              of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, representing a one-hot
              encoding of the class index.

        Rules regarding number of channels in the yielded images:
            - if `color_mode` is `grayscale`,
              there's 1 channel in the image tensors.
            - if `color_mode` is `rgb`,
              there are 3 channels in the image tensors.
            - if `color_mode` is `rgba`,
              there are 4 channels in the image tensors.
